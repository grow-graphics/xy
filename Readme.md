# XY Spatial Math Module [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/grow.graphics/xy.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/grow.graphics/xy)

This module provides a spatial math module for Go, useful for graphics programming, is a purego, zero-dependencies port of
the Godot Math Variants, AABB, Basis, Plane, Projection, Quaternion, Rect2, Rect2i, Transform2D, Transform3D, Vector2, 
Vector2i, Vector3, Vector3i, Vector4 and Vector4i.

Used in `grow.graphics/gd` to represent the aforementioned variant types, has been factored out into its own module so that
it can be useful as a general math module for other projects.
